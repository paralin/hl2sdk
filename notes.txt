* About *
*********
This version of the Source/Half-Life 2 SDK attempts to provide support for GCC 4.x and remove as many
warnings as possible when compiling under Windows or Linux. In addition, the -fpermissive option has
been removed from the Linux makefiles and -Wall has been added.

* Notes *
*********
1. The file "Makefile.mod" located in the linux_sdk directory has been renamed to "Makefile.game" in
   order to avoid potential conflicts with the Modula-2 compiler. GNU Make may issue an error about the
   file with its original name and try to execute m2c (the Modula-2 compiler program).

2. Makefiles for choreoobjects_i486.a, mathlib_i486.a, and tier1_i486.a have been added in the linux_sdk
   directory to ease compiling of these static libraries on Linux if it ever becomes necessary.
   
3. The SDK does not currently compile with GCC 4.2. This will be addressed in the future.
